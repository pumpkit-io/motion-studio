# Build log

What was built for reelcut v0.1.0, ticket by ticket: versions pinned, deviations from the build guide and why, and open issues. Spec: GitHub issue #1. Guide: `video-harness-build-guide.md`.

## Phase 0: environment (ticket #2)

Checked on 2026-10-24.

| Item | Value |

| Homebrew | 7.0.7 |
| ffmpeg | 9.0.1 (Homebrew) |

| Python | 3.12.10 (Homebrew `python@3.12`) |

ffmpeg filters (`ffmpeg -hide_banner -filters`):

| Filter | Present |
|---|---|
| tonemap | yes |
| loudnorm | yes |
| sidechaincompress | yes |
| ebur128 | yes |
| blackdetect | yes |
| freezedetect | yes |
| arnndn | yes |
| colorspace | yes |
| scale_vt | yes |
| zscale | **no** |
| libplacebo | no |

`zscale` is missing from Homebrew's ffmpeg. ADR 0003 covers it: on macOS, ingest tone-maps HLG and PQ to BT.709 with VideoToolbox `scale_vt`; it uses `zscale` + `tonemap` where `zscale` exists, and otherwise falls back to `colorspace` with a warning. The system ffmpeg is not replaced.

Repository: the private remote `pumpkit-io/reelcut` already exists (spec #1 overrides the guide's "no remote"), so Phase 0 verified it instead of running `git init`. Work happens on `feat/reelcut-v0.1.0`; each ticket merges into it.

Also noted: a stale Intel `/usr/local/bin/python3.9` makes `uv python list` error ("Bad CPU type"); `uv python find 3.12` and everything that pins 3.12 work. `pre-commit` is not installed globally; it comes from the dev group (`uv run pre-commit install`).

## Phase 1: scaffold and tooling (ticket #2)

Built:

- The §4 layout under `src/reelcut/` as empty modules with docstrings, `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, `tests/fixtures`, `schemas/` and `scripts/gen_schemas.py` (an empty contract registry that later tickets fill).
- `pyproject.toml` (hatchling, Python `>=3.12,<3.14`, console script `reelcut = "reelcut.cli:app"`), extras `mac` (mlx-whisper, arm64 macOS marker) and `cpu` (faster-whisper), and a dev dependency group. `uv.lock` is committed.
- `reelcut --help` and `reelcut --version` through a Typer app in `src/reelcut/cli/`. `APP_NAME` lives once, in `src/reelcut/__init__.py`; `__version__` reads the package metadata.
- ruff (lint and format), pyright (standard mode, strict on `edl/` and `analysis/`), pytest with strict markers `slow`, `mac`, `models`, `renderer`, `music`.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with local hooks that run the project's pinned tools.
- `justfile`: `setup`, `lint`, `fmt`, `test`, `test-all`, `schema`, `schema-check`, `ci`.
- `renderer/`: a minimal Remotion v4 TypeScript project with one composition, `Reel`. All Remotion packages pinned to 4.0.538.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: on every pushed branch and on pull requests, Ubuntu runs `uv sync --locked --extra cpu`, `npm ci`, `just lint`, `just schema-check` and `just test`.
- LICENSE (MIT), README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP (guide §13 plus parakeet-mlx, CrisperWhisper and Claude Code plugin packaging), THIRD_PARTY, `docs/dependencies.md`. The developer section was added to `AGENTS.md` above the existing `## Agent skills` block, and `CLAUDE.md` contains `@AGENTS.md`.

Pinned versions: see `docs/dependencies.md`. Every core dependency was checked for an arm64 macOS wheel for Python 3.12 on PyPI before pinning.

Deviations and why:

- No `crisper` extra and no `parakeet-mlx` in `mac`, per spec #1.
- Core dependencies are pinned with `==` in `pyproject.toml`, not just in `uv.lock`, because `uv tool install` ignores the lockfile and §10 asks for determinism.
- The renderer was written from the official blank template rather than by running the interactive `npx create-video`. ESLint is left out for now; `tsc --noEmit` lints the renderer.
- `vitest run --passWithNoTests` until the renderer libraries (camera, caption paging) and their tests land.
- `ruff` excludes `*.md`: ruff 0.17 formats Python blocks inside Markdown and would rewrite the guide's code samples.
- TypeScript type generation from `schemas/timeline.schema.json` is not wired yet; `schema-check` already covers `renderer/src/types.gen.ts` so it applies as soon as the contracts ticket generates it.
- CI pins uv 0.5.21 to match the build machine so `uv sync --locked` reads the same lockfile format.

Open issues: none.
